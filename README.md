# TensorFlow-Creative-Applications

I am walking through my TensorFlow learning from multiple websites, but predominantly from Kadenze. These notebooks will serve as a quick intro to TensorFlow to those who are comfortable with Python in general. 

### Prerequisites
1) Python  
2) Numpy  
3) Scikit-lean  
4) TensorFlow  
5) Patience  

There are 5 modules, 
### Introduction
In the intro iPython notebook you'll find a walkthough of loading images, reshaping them, tensorflow basics like session, plotting a gaussian curve, convolution with a gaussian kernel, construction of a gabor filter and convolution with it. I also wrote code that shows how to use placeholders to do all of the above task. The image gabor filter output was produced by a convolution of skimage.data.camera with the said gabor kernel.

In the homework part, we collect 100 images, reshape them to the same size, find their mean and produce more convolutions.
